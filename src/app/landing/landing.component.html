      Hello World is the weekend of September 16th and we're looking for mentors to help freshman students through their first hackathon projects! As a mentor your responsibilities are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> • Answering questions about technologies the students are using </li>
      <li> • Setting up and breaking down the event </li>
      <li> • Helping out during the event like serving food or setting up tech talks </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We will inform you of your assigned time slots as it gets closer to the event. We will also be having a required orientation for all mentors whose date we will inform you of later. Thanks for deciding to help with the event!
